# Docker Setup for Agentic Workflow

This document describes how to run the Agentic Workflow application using Docker.

## Prerequisites

- Docker installed on your system
- Docker Compose installed on your system

## Quick Start

1. Create a `.env` file with your API keys based on the `.env.example` template:
   ```
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   Then edit the `.env` file to add your API keys.

2. Build and start the Docker container:
   ```
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

3. Access the Streamlit application at: http://localhost:8501

4. To stop the application:
   ```
   docker-compose down
   ```

## Building Without Docker Compose

If you prefer to use Docker directly:

1. Build the Docker image:
   ```
   docker build -t agentic-workflow .
   ```

2. Run the container:
   ```
   docker run -p 8501:8501 -v $(pwd)/.env:/app/.env -v $(pwd)/data:/app/data agentic-workflow
   ```

## Environment Variables

All required environment variables should be defined in your `.env` file. See `.env.example` for the required variables.

## Data Persistence

The application mounts a volume at `/app/data` to persist any data generated by the application.

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter permission issues with mounted volumes, check the permissions of your local directories.
- If the application fails to start, check the logs with `docker-compose logs` or `docker logs [container-id]`.
